#Optimization (Non-Functional, System, Derived, Quantitative, Software)
Make sure the code runs fast enough to have a semi realtime experience

Priority: High
Estimated time: 40

Details:
Optimization step. We are looking to have the program produce minmum of 25 frames per second

Tasks:
- optimize the code based on memory(5)
- Optimize the code based on performance(5)
- make sure code is running on GPU and not CPU (30)
