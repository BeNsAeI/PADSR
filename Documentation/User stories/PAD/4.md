Use tools to take the depthmap stream and the full video stream and create a 3D video

Priority: low
Estimated time: 40

Details:
Use OpenGL or thirdparty software to make a 3d movie using the depthmap

Tasks:
OpenGL:
- create a vertex shader that takes in depth map stream and uses it to set height
- create a fragment shader that takes in the video stream
- create a C++ code that takes the two streams and produces the 3D executable
Thirdparty:
- find a list of 3rd party tools that help create 3D video
- learn how to use it
- produce the video
