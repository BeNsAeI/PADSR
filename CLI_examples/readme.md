These are examples of popular python packages for developing interactive command line interfases.

The `curses` module produces applications that interact via a plaintext terminal window, but are not limited to simple text input and output; they can paint the screen with options that are selected from using the cursor keys.

`Python Prompt Toolkit` is a library for building powerful interactive command lines and terminal applications in Python. It provides a lot of advanced visual features like syntax highlighting, bottom bars, and the ability to create fullscreen apps.

`Click` is a Python package for creating beautiful command line interfaces in a composable way with as little code as necessary. It is more geared towards command line utilities instead of command line interpreters, but it can be used for either.
