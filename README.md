Pralax Assisted Depth-Map and Super Resolution on a Drone Platform
___
- Pralax Assisted Depth-Ma:
In this project our goal is to generate a 3D model of the scene using a single camera on a moving platform. The depth data is produced using several images from the scene and tracking multiple objects. This is done using traditional methods and enhanced using the paralax effect.
___
- Super reolution: The goal for this project is to produce an image with higher resolution than the camera is capable of producing. this is done using the moving fence effect.
